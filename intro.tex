<< Introduce deductive verification >>

Classical logics, such as first-order logic with least fixpoints or higher order logics, are often static in the sense that formulas 
describe the state of a single world. 
Verification conditions of imperative programs describe typically at least two different worlds--- the pre-state
and the post-state of a program snippet. Consequently, expressing validity of verification conditions
naturally involves the challenge of expressing the evolving worlds of program states in a static logic.
The classical notion of strongest post-condition for programs with scalar variables does precisely this--- 
it expresses the precondition and the intermediate states of the program and the post-state using \emph{auxilliary} 
first-order variables that capture the scalar variables at these states. The weakest precondition, again for
programs with scalar variables, solves the same problem.

The focus of this paper is in generating logical formulations of verification conditions for program snippets that manipulate the heap.
In this setting, the heap consists, minimally, of a set of pointer fields that are modeled by \emph{first-order
functions}, and the program's execution alters these functions.
Consequently, the translation of validity of verification conditions to validity of logic formulas changes considerably.
%The goal of this paper is to identify a new class of logics that can express the verification conditions of
%such programs precisely, while at the same time being amenable to automated reasoning.

Let us consider a set of pointer fields $\vect{p}$ and a recursive definition of a unary predicate or function $R(x)$ defined
using least fixpoints over $\vect{p}$. Typical functions include properties such as 
``$x$ points to a linked list segment ending at the location $z$'', ``the length of the list pointed to be $x$'', 
``$x$ points to a binary search tree'', ``the set of keys stored in the tree pointed to by $x$'', ``the heaplet defined
by the tree pointed to by $x$'', etc.
Consider a Hoare triple of the form $\textit{@pre}(\vect{x}, \vect{p}, R) ~S~ \textit{@post}(\vect{x}, \vect{p}, R)$, the pre- and post-conditions use the recursively defined predicate/function $R$.

One simple approach is to capture the precondition using logic and use the \emph{frame rule} to reason soundly
(but incompletely) about the post-state--- i.e., we can simply ignore the definition of $R$
on the transformed heap, and just say that $R'(x)$ is guaranteed to hold if it held in the pre-state and 
the $\Delta$ portion of the heap modified did not intersect with the heaplet of the definition of $R$.
This is, in practice, a very \emph{convenient and simple} reasoning that often works, but is incomplete.
For example, consider the following Hoare triple with pre/post conditions written in FO+lfp,
where $list(x)$ means $x$ points to a list, and in which
case, $hlist(x)$ stands for the set of locations in that list: \\
\centerline{$ \{ list(x) \wedge  list(w) \wedge  y \not \in hlist(w) \} 
~~~~~\texttt{y.next := w}~~~~~
\{list(x) \}$}\\
\noindent In this case, the Hoare triple does hold, but frame reasoning is insufficient to argue it--- since $y$ can be
in $hlist(x)$ in the pre-state, the frame rule is insufficient in inferring that the postcondition continues to hold. 
(The above can also be formulated in separation logic, of course, and frame reasoning alone will continue to be
ineffective.)

Let us now focus on basic blocks $S$ that do not involve function calls. We would like
to generate precise verification conditions in such cases, while falling back on frame reasoning for function calls. 
There are several approaches in the literature that argue for this--- for example the Grasshopper suite of tools
handle such blocks accurately~\cite{}, and there is work on
expressing weakest pre-conditions for separation logic formulas and such blocks 
using the magic wand.

One precise formulation of the verification condition is 
$\textit{@pre}(\vect{x}, R) \wedge T(\vect{x}, \vect{x}', \vect{p}, \vect{p}') \wedge \textit{@post}(\vect{x}', \vect{p}', R')$
where $T$ describes the effect of the program on the stack and the heap, describing how the scalar variables $\vect{x}$ and
 pointer-fields $\vect{p}$ have evolved to the scalar variables $\vect{x}'$ and $\vect{p}'$.
Most importantly, the new recursive definitions $R'$ are \emph{reformulated} by replacing $\vect{p}$ in the definition of $R$
with $\vect{p}'$. 

Though the above is a precise formulation of the verification condition, it has several drawbacks. First, there is a heaplet $H$
modified by the program, and the formula will have conjuncts of the form $\forall y \not \in H. p'(y)=p(y)$, for every $p \in \vect{p}$.
 This introduces
universal quantification, which is harder to reason with automatically--- however, for basic blocks that do not involve
function calls, i.e, when $H$ is finite, we can map this into a decidable quantifier free logic (modeling $p$ as an array
and $p'$ as an update to the array).
Second, the new definition of $R'$ depends on $\vect{p}'$, which in turn depends on the various constraints introduced by the basic
block. For example, pointer fields may change depending on complex properties involving the data elements stored in the heap.
Reasoning with $R'$ which involves least fixpoints, coupled with such constraints is daunting.

\emph{Surely, there must be a simpler formulation of the verification condition!} The delta changes to the heap do cause global changes and
can dramatically affect the valuation of recursively defined predicates/functions, which are global.
But surely, the effect on the semantics of $R'$ must be expressible in a simpler localized fashion.

In this paper, we describe a class of logics, called \emph{delta logics,} that are precisely meant to solve the above issues.
Formulas in delta logics are Boolean combinations of two distinct kinds of formulas--- one kind, called delta-specific
formulas, talk strictly about the modified portion of the heap (identifiied by a bounded set of location $\Delta$) without using
any recursive definitions, while the other 
kind, called contextual formulas, talk strictly talk about the unbounded heap different from $\Delta$ using recursive definitions.
The common free variables $X$ between these sets of formulas are used to \emph{communicate} information between the $\Delta$
portion of the heap and its context. In particular, a recursive definition $R$ over the unbounded context are \emph{parameterized}
over a set of first-order communication variables $Par^R$, where $Par^R$ summarizes the value of $R$ within $\Delta$.
These variables themselves can, of course, depend on the value of $R$ outside $\Delta$ as well, setting up mutally restricting
constraints. 

We prove several key results. First, we show a \emph{separability theorem} that shows that any quantifier-free FO formula
with recursive definitions can be expressed in delta logics, i.e., as a Boolean combination of delta specific formulas
and context formulas. We prove this by setting up communication between the two portions of the heap, and it turns out that
a new set of recursive definitions and communication variables involving the \emph{rank} for recursive definitions is
needed to accurately capture least fixpoints. These ranks can however be constrained to be \emph{bounded} integers,
as opposed to ordinals, even though the heap is infinite. 

Second, we argue that verification conditions of basic blocks without function calls can be expressed precisely using delta logics.
The key idea here is to set up \emph{two parameterized sets} of recursive definitions, expressing the pre-condition using
one and the post-condition using the other. The change to the heaplet can be described using FOL as usual, and the pre and post
conditions can be translated to delta logic formulas using the separation theorem above. Notice that this captures naturally
captures the changing $\Delta$ portion of the heap while keeping the context unchanged, 
hence removes the need for the universally quantified formula asserting that pointers in the context have not changed.

We turn then to specific delta logics and explore decidability results for them. We define a delta logic that expresses
properties of list segments along with a variety of measures on them, including their heaplets (for expressing separation properties), 
their lengths, the multisets of keys stored in them, the min/max keys stored in them, and their sortedness. We consider the context-logic
corresponding to this delta logic, and by exploiting the simplicity of delta logics (namely, that the recursive definitions change only
with respect to the communication parameters, which correspond to base cases of these definitions), we show that they
can be transformed to equivalent formulas expressed as quantifier-free formulas \emph{without} recursive definitions. This
leads us to a decision procedure for delta logics for linked lists with all the six measures above, and hence a decidable logic
for verification conditions of programs manipulating linked lists with pre- and post-conditions expressed using the above measures.

Finally, we implement and evaluate our technique by expressing VCs using delta logics and validating them using our decision procedure
on a suite of programs, and show it to be effective. 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the most expressive decidable logic over lists in existing literature. 

Whie our decidability result is interesting in its own right, we emphasize the main contribution of this paper is, in our view, 
the definition and advocacy of delta logics as a logic for verification conditions. 
Traditional ways of reducing validation of verification conditions to logic embed the verifcation in logics that have much
more expressive power than necessary, and harder to reason with; we think it is a reduction from an easier problem to a harder problem!
Delta-logics explicitly delineate the changed portion of the heap and only allow recursive definitions to be parameterized over 
first-order communication variables, and avoid introducing quantification, making them easier to reason with.
